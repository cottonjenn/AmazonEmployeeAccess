## Amazon Employee Access Kaggle Competition

The Amazon Employee Access Challenge is a Kaggle classification competition that aims to predict whether an employee should be granted access to specific internal Amazon resources based on historical access patterns. The dataset consists almost entirely of high-cardinality categorical features, making effective representation learning and interaction modeling critical. Submissions are evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric. 

In this project, I built a winning solution using a Random Forest model combined with PCA for dimensionality reduction, achieving an AUC score of 0.88535 and securing a top position on the competition leaderboard.
